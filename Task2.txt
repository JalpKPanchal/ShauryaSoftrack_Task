Difference Between PUT and POST in REST APIs
POST
Use: To create a new resource.

ID: Server generates the ID.

Effect: Adds a new entry every time.

Example: POST /api/register --> Creates a new user.

Status Code: 201 Created

In My Project: Used in /api/register to add users to the database.

PUT

Use: To update an existing resource or create at a specific ID.

ID: Client provides the ID.

Effect: Replaces the data for that ID.

Example: PUT /api/users/1 --> Updates user with ID 1.

Status Code: 200 OK or 201 if created

In My Project: Not used yet, but can be used to update user info.
